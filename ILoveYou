Happy Birthday, Babe(soon to be Mommy) ❤️

From the very first time we met back in intramuals, to the little moments like borrowing a scientific calculator in college,
who would have thought that those small beginnings would grow into 10 years of love, laughter, and life together.

We’ve been through so much ups and downs, misunderstandings, the battles we faced with problems, anxiety, depression,
and even the pain of losing loved ones. But through it all, I’ve seen you fight, grow strotnger, and shine brighter than ever.
I admire your courage, your strength, and the way you keep moving forward no matter how heavy life gets.

I thank our Lord Jesus Christ 🙏🙏for you every single day for your life, your love, and the gift of being your partner.
I want you to know that in every season of our lives, whether its joy or struggle, I will always choose you.
Thank you for being my partner, my best friend, and my home.
Ten years may have passed, but my love for you keeps growing, deeper and stronger every single day.

On your special day, I just want to remind you that you are loved, appreciated, and cherished more than words can ever say.
Im so proud of the woman you’ve become, and I’m grateful that I get to spend this life with you.

And as we prepare to welcome our soonto be baby, I know that we will only grow stronger together.
For our little one, we will be a team, we will be a home filled with love, faith, and strength.
Our future may not always be perfect, but with God’s guidance and our love for each other,
I know we will give our baby the best life we can—rooted in love, patience, and joy. ❤️

Happy Birthday, Babe, langga, Day, and soon to be mommy.
Here’s to more years of laughter, love, dreams, and the beautiful journey of becoming a family. ❤️
